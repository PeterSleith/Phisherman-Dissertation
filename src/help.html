        <p>First, Go to</p>
        <h3>https://takeout.google.com/?hl=en</h3>
        <p>This page allows you to download any data google contains about your accounts.</p>
        <h3>Deselect all, then only select 'Mail'</h3>
        <p>this is to ensure we dont download all of your Google data, which would take a very long time</p>

        <h3>Click on 'All Mail Data Included'</h3>
        <p>We will now reduce the data included from the download to be just emails in the SPAM folder</p>
