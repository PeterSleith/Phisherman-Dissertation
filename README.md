Installation:
    Installation of the Chrome App:
        To install this app onto an existing chrome browser. Download the repository and extract to a file.
        Then Navigate to 'Manage Extensions' in Google Chrome.
        Then select 'Load Unpacked' and select the folder
        The Extension is now installed, I recommend pinning the extension for quick access to the setup menu. 
    Installation of the local Server
        Please open the same file used for the chrome extension in visual studio code (preferably). 
        In the command bar type 'npm install' and ensure port 5000 is free on your local network
        then type 'npm run build' to start the server
        From here on the chome extension will be fully functional and analyse emails as you open them in Gmail.

I appreciate one file for both parts is poor practice, this was done as to make for an easier installation that required only one folder.
